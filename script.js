// Conditional Statements

// Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions

// Javascript conditional statements:
// if (executes a block of code if condition is true)
// else (executes a block of code if same condition is false)
// else if (a new condition if first condition is false)
// switch (many alternative blocks of code)
// ? (inline conditional statement)

// Conditionals are a core part of writing dynamic and interactive code
