// Conditional Statements

// Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions

// Javascript conditional statements:
// if (executes a block of code if condition is true)
// else (executes a block of code if same condition is false)
// else if (a new condition if first condition is false)
// switch (many alternative blocks of code)
// ? (inline conditional statement)

// Conditionals are a core part of writing dynamic and interactive code

// IF statement

// The if statement evaluates a condition, and if the result is "true" it executes the block of code

/* Syntax of an if statement

    if (condition) {
        // code to run if condition is true
    }

let year = 2025;

if (year == 2025) {
  console.log("The year is 2025!"); // The year is 2025! (year == 2025 is true)
}
